## A Demonstration Project

The ImageBank Application in this repository is a demonstration piece showing the interaction between React and Spring Boot.  Infrastructure issues such as handling logins securely, using TLS in both production and development is maintained through out.  The impetus behind this project is learning what works, what doesn't and expanding upon this knowledge to leverage every piece of React, Spring Boot and Java.

## Project Goals

I started this project in the summer of 2024, and will work on it as time permits.  The goal is to get a working version of ImageBank to run in the AWS Cloud, eventually moving towards a microservice architecture.
